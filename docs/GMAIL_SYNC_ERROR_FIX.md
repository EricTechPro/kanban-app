# Gmail Sync Error Fix

## Issue

The error `useGmailThreadSync.useCallback[syncGmailThreads]` was occurring because:

1. The API endpoint `/api/gmail/threads/by-labels` didn't exist
2. The error handling was throwing exceptions instead of gracefully handling the case when Gmail is not connected

## Solution

### 1. Created Missing API Endpoint

- Created `/app/api/gmail/threads/by-labels/route.ts`
- This endpoint fetches Gmail threads organized by kanban stage labels
- Uses cookie-based authentication like other Gmail API routes

### 2. Fixed Error Handling

- Updated `syncGmailThreads` to return a result object instead of throwing errors
- Now returns `{ success: boolean, totalAdded: number, error?: string }`
- Gracefully handles the case when Gmail is not connected

### 3. Updated Components

- `GmailAutoSync` now properly handles the return value from `syncGmailThreads`
- Shows appropriate error messages when Gmail is not connected
- Doesn't crash the application when sync fails

## How It Works Now

1. When the dashboard loads, `GmailAutoSync` checks if Gmail is connected
2. If not connected, it silently fails without throwing errors
3. If connected, it attempts to sync Gmail threads
4. Any errors are logged and displayed in the UI without crashing

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Visit http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. If Gmail is not connected, you'll see the "Connect Gmail" button
3. No errors should appear in the console
4. Once connected, Gmail threads will automatically sync
