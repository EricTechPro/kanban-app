### **Section 6: Epic and Story Structure**

#### Epic 1: Gmail Workflow Integration & AI Summarization

**Epic Goal**: To transform the application into a "Gmail-first" workflow tool by integrating directly with the Gmail API, enabling automatic card creation from labeled emails, and providing AI-powered summaries to streamline user workflows.

#### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)

_(Duration: 8-10 weeks)_

**Scope**: Gmail OAuth integration, read-only label-based column creation, basic email-to-card conversion, and a manual sync trigger.

**Stories**:

- **1.1: Connect Gmail Account**: As a user, I want to connect my Gmail account via a secure OAuth flow so that the application can access my emails and labels.
- **1.2: View Gmail Labels as Columns**: As a user, I want the application to read my "kanban-flow" labels from Gmail and display them as columns on the board, so that I can visualize my workflow.
- **1.3: View Emails as Basic Cards**: As a user, I want emails with a workflow label in Gmail to appear as cards in the corresponding column, with the email subject as the card title, so that I can see my work items.
- **1.4: Manually Trigger Sync**: As a new user, I want a "Sync with Gmail" button so that I can fetch the latest email and label data on demand.

#### Phase 2: Core Synchronization

_(Duration: 6-8 weeks)_

**Scope**: Implement full bidirectional sync, enhance email parsing for key fields, and support bulk operations.

**Stories**:

- **2.1: Update Gmail Label by Moving Card**: As a user, I want to move a card from one column to another and have the corresponding email's label updated automatically in Gmail, so that my two systems stay in sync.
- **2.2: Implement Real-Time Sync**: As a user, I want changes made in Gmail (e.g., adding a label to an email) to be reflected in the app automatically, so that the board is always up-to-date.
- **2.3: Implement Conflict Resolution**: As a system, I need a mechanism to gracefully handle sync conflicts (e.g., a card is moved in the app at the same time its label is changed in Gmail).
- **2.4: Parse Key Data from Emails**: As a user, I want the system to automatically parse and populate fields like dates and priority from the email content, so that my cards are more informative with less manual entry.

#### Phase 3: AI Integration

_(Duration: 4-6 weeks)_

**Scope**: Integrate an AI service for email summarization, allow for custom prompts, and implement caching and cost controls.

**Stories**:

- **3.1: View AI-Powered Summaries**: As a user, I want to click on a card and see a concise, AI-generated summary of the email thread, so that I can quickly understand its content and key action items.
- **3.2: Configure AI Prompts**: As a power user, I want to create and save custom system prompts for the AI summarizer, so that I can tailor the summaries to my specific workflow needs.
- **3.3: Cache AI Summaries**: As a system, I need to cache AI summaries to reduce processing time and API costs for previously summarized emails.

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features

_(Duration: 6-8 weeks)_

**Scope**: Add support for multiple Gmail accounts, advanced filtering, and mobile optimization.

**Stories**:

- **4.1: Connect Multiple Gmail Accounts**: As a user with multiple roles (e.g., personal brand and agency), I want to connect more than one Gmail account and switch between them.
- **4.2: Implement Advanced Filtering**: As a user, I want to filter my Kanban board by email sender, date range, and other metadata, so I can easily find specific items.
- **4.3: Optimize for Mobile**: As a mobile user, I want the Gmail-integrated board to be fully responsive and easy to use on my smartphone.
