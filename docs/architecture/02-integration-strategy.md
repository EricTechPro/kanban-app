### **Section 2: Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy**

#### Enhancement Overview

- **Enhancement Type**: Major Feature Addition & System Integration.
- **Scope**: Integrate Gmail as a primary data source, introduce a new AI summarization service, and build a bidirectional data synchronization mechanism.
- **Integration Impact**: High. This requires a new backend service, a database, and significant changes to the data management and user onboarding flows.

#### Integration Approach

- **Code Integration Strategy**: We will build a **new, separate microservice** responsible for all Gmail API interactions, background synchronization, and AI summarization processing. This decouples heavy background tasks from the frontend, allows independent scaling, and enhances security.
- **Database Integration**: A new PostgreSQL database will be introduced to store user account information, encrypted Gmail tokens, email metadata, AI summaries, and sync state.
- **UI Integration**: The Next.js frontend will communicate with the new backend microservice via a secure **tRPC API**.

#### Compatibility Requirements

- **Hybrid Mode**: The architecture will support both manual deals (migrated from localStorage to the database) and Gmail-integrated deals.
- **Backward Compatibility**: For users who do not opt into the Gmail integration, the existing functionality will be preserved. A one-time migration path will be provided for existing data.
