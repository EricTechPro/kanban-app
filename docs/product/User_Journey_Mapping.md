# User Journey Mapping - Gmail Integration Enhancement

## Section 3: User Journeys

### **First-Time User Journey**

1. **Login** → A user logs into the application and initiates the Gmail connection process via an OAuth screen, which includes a clear permission explanation.

2. **Label Discovery** → The application scans for existing "kanban-flow" labels and sub-labels (1-, 2-, 3-, etc.). If found, it presents options to import the structure. If not found, it offers to create the recommended label hierarchy or allows custom column naming while maintaining numeric ordering.

3. **Initial Import** → The system begins processing emails from the selected labels, displaying a progress indicator to manage user expectations during the wait.

4. **Data Validation** → The system displays a preview of converted emails-to-cards, allowing users to verify the mapping looks correct before proceeding to the tutorial.

5. **Tutorial** → The user is presented with a brief walkthrough, such as "Your first email is now a card," to demonstrate the core functionality.

6. **AI Setup** → Users are prompted to set their preferences for AI summarization, including the ability to select or create custom prompts.

7. **First Interaction** → The user is encouraged to move a card, triggering the bidirectional sync and confirming the connection to Gmail is active.

### **Daily Usage Journey**

1. **App Launch** → Upon opening the app, the user sees a clear indicator of the background sync status.

2. **New Content** → As new emails are labeled in Gmail, they automatically appear as new cards on the board.

3. **Workflow Management** → The user moves cards between columns, and the corresponding Gmail labels are updated seamlessly in near real-time.

4. **Detail View** → Clicking on a card opens a detailed view where the AI-generated summary loads with the email context.

5. **Bulk Operations** → Users can select multiple cards and move them simultaneously, with a confirmation dialog showing the Gmail label changes that will occur.

6. **AI Customization** → Users can modify AI prompts or request re-summarization of specific email threads based on updated preferences.

### **Error Recovery Journey**

1. **Sync Failure** → The UI displays a clear, non-intrusive error message and provides an option to retry the sync.

2. **Quota Exceeded** → The application enters a gracefully degraded state, notifies the user of the Gmail API quota issue, and informs them when functionality will be restored.

3. **Permission Revoked** → If Gmail access is revoked, the user is guided through a re-authentication flow to restore the connection.

4. **Offline Mode** → If the user is offline, actions are queued locally. Upon reconnection, the queue is processed to sync with Gmail.

5. **Network Issues** → During intermittent connectivity, the app shows sync status indicators and queues operations, with clear messaging about what will sync when connection is restored.

6. **Sync Conflicts** → When the same email is modified in both Gmail and the app simultaneously, the user is presented with a conflict resolution interface showing both versions and allowing them to choose or merge changes.

### **Power User Journey**

1. **Multi-Account Setup** → Users with multiple Gmail accounts can connect additional accounts and manage separate workflows.

2. **Advanced Filtering** → Users create complex filters to automatically categorize incoming emails into appropriate workflow stages.

3. **Bulk Email Management** → Users process large volumes of emails (100+) with batch operations and progress tracking.

4. **Custom Automation** → Users set up rules for automatic email processing and AI summarization triggers.

### **Mobile Usage Journey**

1. **Mobile Sync** → User opens mobile app and sees real-time sync with desktop changes.

2. **Quick Actions** → User performs common actions (move card, view summary) optimized for mobile interaction.

3. **Offline Mobile** → User works offline on mobile with clear indicators of pending sync operations.
